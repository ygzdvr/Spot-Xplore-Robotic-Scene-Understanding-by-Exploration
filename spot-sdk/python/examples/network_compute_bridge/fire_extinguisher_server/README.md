# Fire Extinguisher Detector Server

This is an example of a Network Compute Bridge server. It is similar to `tensorflow_server.py`, but uses Keras Retinanet instead of TensorFlow. The provided model specifically detects fire extinguishers.

## Build and Export

This example can be run on a local machine directly, but is easier to use with Docker.

The Docker image can be built and exported with the following commands:

```
# builds the image
sudo docker build -t fire_ext_detector .

# exports the image, uses pigz
sudo docker save fire_ext_detector | pigz > fire_ext_detector.tar.gz
```

To build the image for CORE I/O:

```
# Prerequisites
# Install the pigz and qemu packages
sudo apt-get install qemu binfmt-support qemu-user-static pigz
# This step will execute the registering scripts
docker run --rm --privileged multiarch/qemu-user-static --reset -p yes

# Builds the image
sudo docker build -t fire_ext_detector:l4t -f Dockerfile.l4t .

# Exports the image, uses pigz
sudo docker save fire_ext_detector:l4t | pigz > fire_ext_detector.tar.gz
```

## Execution

To run this example on a Spot CORE, run:

```
./start_server.sh
```

Otherwise, create a .env file that specifies username and password with the following variables.
BOSDYN_CLIENT_USERNAME={username}
BOSDYN_CLIENT_PASSWORD={password}

Then run:

```
sudo docker run -d --name retinanet_server --network host --env-file .env --restart unless-stopped fire_ext_detector -d . --port $PORT $ROBOT_IP
```

- `$PORT` is the port to use for the server on the machine the server is running on
- `$ROBOT_IP` is the IP address or hostname of your Spot.
- `BOSDYN_CLIENT_USERNAME` is the environment variable for the username for the robot
- `BOSDYN_CLIENT_PASSWORD` is the environment variable for the password for the robot

To run this example on a CORE I/O, run:

```
# Load the image
sudo docker load -i fire_ext_detector.tar.gz

# Run the container
sudo docker run -d \
    --gpus all \
    --name retinanet_server \
    --network host \
    --restart unless-stopped \
    -v /opt/payload_credentials/payload_guid_and_secret:/opt/payload_credentials/payload_guid_and_secret \
    fire_ext_detector:l4t \
    -d . 192.168.50.3 --payload-credentials-file /opt/payload_credentials/payload_guid_and_secret
```

## Spot Extension for CORE I/O

This example can also be built into a [Spot Extension](../../../../docs/payload/docker_containers.md) using a provided [convenience script](../../extensions/README.md)

```sh
cd {/path/to/python/examples/network_compute_bridge/fire_extinguisher_server/}

python3 ../../extensions/build_extension.py \
    --dockerfile-paths Dockerfile.l4t \
    --build-image-tags fire_ext_detector:l4t \
    -i fire_ext_detector_image.tar.gz \
    --package-dir . \
    --spx fire_extinguisher_detector.spx
```

The output file will be called fire_ext_detector.spx and can be uploaded to a CORE I/O.

## Action Configuration

To configure the Fire Extinguisher Detector as an Inspection on Spot's control tablet, go to Hamburger menu --> SETTINGS --> ACTIONS.

![hamburger_settings_actions.jpg](./hamburger_settings_actions.jpg)

Scroll down to CUSTOM INSPECTIONS and select "Create New Action."

![custom_inspections_create_new_action.jpg](./custom_inspections_create_new_action.jpg)

Choose the "Empty Inspection" template action and click the CREATE button.

![choose_empty_inspection_action_template.jpg](./choose_empty_inspection_action_template.jpg)

Set the ROBOT BODY CONTROL to "Body Pose" and the ACTION to "Daq."

![name_body_pose_control_daq_action.jpg](./name_body_pose_control_daq_action.jpg)

Click "Add Network Compute Bridge Workers" and select "Fire Extinguisher Server - Fire Ext"

![ncb_worker_fire_extinguisher_server.jpg](./ncb_worker_fire_extinguisher_server.jpg)

Add the Spot CAM - Ptz as an input image to the `Fire Extinguisher Server - Fire Ext` Network Compute Bridge Worker. Note that this input image is what will be used as the input to the Worker. It is not a standalone image. So, make sure to add an input image and not a standalone image.
![input_image_spot_cam_ptz.jpg](./input_image_spot_cam_ptz.jpg)

Click save to finish configuring the action.

The configuration can be verified by teleoperating Spot to a fire extinguisher and setting up a clear shot with the SPOT CAM PTZ.

![set_up_shot_and_hit_red_action_button.jpg](./set_up_shot_and_hit_red_action_button.jpg)

Click the red action button, select the configured action and fine tune the shot.

![fine_tune_shot_in_action.jpg](./fine_tune_shot_in_action.jpg)

Click CONFIGURE to observe the input image.

![observe_input_on_first_page.jpg](./observe_input_on_first_page.jpg)

After a short period of time, you can see the output of the worker on the second page by clicking the arrows below the input image.

![observe_output_on_second_page.jpg](./observe_output_on_second_page.jpg)

If you see a green box around the fire extinguisher gauge, then the action is configured and working correctly. If you do not see any green boxes, then reduce the "MIN_CONFIDENCE" or exit the action and set up a clearer shot of the fire extinguisher (e.g., consider zooming out further than indicated in the above screenshots).
