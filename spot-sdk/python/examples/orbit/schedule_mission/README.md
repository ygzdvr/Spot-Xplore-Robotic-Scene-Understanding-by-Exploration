# Create, Edit, and Delete Scheduled Missions on Orbit

This tutorial is a programming example for the Orbit client, which uses the Orbit web API. It demonstrates how to interact with the Orbit calendar using Orbit client API calls. The example code can be run directly to create, edit, or delete a calendar event.

## Understanding Orbit Web API

Please begin with the [Quickstart Guide](../../../../docs/python/quickstart.md) to get your Python programming environment set up properly. Additional useful information can be found in [Orbit API Docs](../../../../docs/concepts/orbit/orbit_api.md). For a complete list of resources and their methods, see the <a href="../../../../docs/orbit/docs.html">Orbit API Reference</a>.

## Setup Dependencies

See the requirements.txt file for a list of python dependencies which can be installed with pip using the command:

```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run the Example

To run the example for local development and testing, run the following command with verify set to False. When set to False, requests will skip server's TLS certificate verifications which will make your application vulnerable. For production software, we recommend you set verify to True or a path to CA bundle.

```
python3 schedule_mission.py --hostname ORBIT_IP --verify False
```

The above command prompts you to provide the API token obtained from the Orbit admin settings page. Alternatively, you can set the environment variable `BOSDYN_ORBIT_CLIENT_API_TOKEN` to the API token obtained from Orbit admin settings page.
