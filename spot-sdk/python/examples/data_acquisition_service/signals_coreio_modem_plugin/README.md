# Modem Signals

Reads modem data from the CORE IO and exposes a new GetLiveData rpc to display signals data during Spot teleoperation.

A core_io_auth.py file is expected to be added in this directory before building and running this example.

```python
USERNAME = "<input-admin-username-here>"
PASSWORD = "<input-admin-password-here>"
```

To build this Spot Extension for the CORE I/O, using the build_extension.py helper on Linux. Additional information can be found [here](../../../../docs/payload/docker_containers.md)

```
python3 ../../extensions/build_extension.py --dockerfile-paths Dockerfile.arm64 --build-image-tags signals_lte:arm64 -i signals_lte_arm.tar.gz --package-dir . --spx signals_lte.spx
```
